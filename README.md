Systems Genetics - Maggi Plutov

In this project we combined genetics and intermediate phenotypes to discover novel findings. 

Final grade - 100

The project is focused on BXD data and involves genotyping data incluing gene expression datasets from both blood stem cells and liver tissue as relevant intermediate traits (GEO accession IDs: GSE17522, GSE18067). 
As for phenotypes, we focused on cocaine response traits where we looked at the same time range, sex and activity type. 
The main difference is the number of injections (1 vs 2), to look for interesting observations.

The project consists of the following parts:
1. Defining the task 
2. Gene expression data preprocessing
3. eQTL analysis association test
4. QTL analysis
5. Combine results
6. Causality analysis
